<p>Greenmount West Community Center and Baltimore Museum of Art had a community partnership with artist, Mark Bradford.  The partnership provided resources to the community center for youth artists and our team to design two platforms for the marketing rollout.</p>
<p>We created two websites for Greenmount West Community Center & Noisy Tenants to share their brand identity & work they are facilitating in the community center.</p>
<p>Designed website using Sketch & Marvel.  Developed using Jekyll with the SiteLeaf CMS.</p>

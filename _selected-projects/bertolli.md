<p>While working as a Front-end Developer at HAVAS, a digital agency located in Baltimore, MD and headquartered in France, I contributed to the redesign of Bertolli's website.  The work was split based on pages and features. My tasks included developing the following pages: How To's, Our Story, Media Press Releases & FAQs.</p>
<p>The website was designed by the HAVAS Creative Team and developed on the Wordpress platform.</p>
<p>Other clients projects include working with Audi, Volkswagen, CitiBank, TD Ameritrade, Liberty Mutual and Advanced Auto Parts</p>

<p>After documenting the system, I was able to target several tasks and transition those to automation tasks.  These tasks consisted of repetitive work such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>- sending client emails</li>
<li>- updating the CRM</li>
<li>- notifying the team of new client activity</li>
<li>- creating tasks in Asana based on different stages of the onboarding process</li>
<li>- setting up client appointments</li></ul>" %}
